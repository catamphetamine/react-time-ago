# Migration

`react-pages` is the new name for the former [`react-website`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-website/tree/3.x) package: it's just a better name, so basically `react-pages` is what `react-website@4.x` was going to be. The breaking change is that `react-website@3.x` comes with `found@0.3.x` router and `react-redux@5.x` while `react-pages` updates those to `found@0.4.x` and `react-redux@6.x`: this is required for React Hooks and for the future React 17 release. Currently `react-pages` is still in "beta" version (not `1.0.0` yet) indicating that it's still being tested and the API could theoretically change in some way.

## Migration from `react-website@3.x` to `react-pages`

### Changes

* Update `react-redux` to `>= 7.1`. Updating from `5.x` to `6.x` has only a [single breaking change](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1104): `withRef` is replaced with `forwardRef`, and therefore any uses of `wrapperComponentInstance.getWrappedInstance()` are replaced with `actualComponentInstance`. Updating from `6.x` to `7.x` [has no breaking changes](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.0.1).
* Update `react` and `react-dom` to `>= 16.8`.
* `@meta()`, `@preload()`, `@onPageLoaded()` decorators are now considered deprecated because they [can't be used on functional components](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). Instead, there're now `meta`, `load` and `onLoaded` static properties: `meta` can be an object or a function returning an object; `load` can be a function, an object of shape `{ load(), client, blocking, blockingSibling }`, or an array of those; `onLoaded` can be a function. The legacy `@meta()`, `@preload()` and `@onPageLoaded()` decorators still work, but also have been rewritten as functions setting static properties of a component rather than creating new "wrapper" React components (there shouldn't be any breaking changes).
* When using "code splitting" feature, `preload`, `preloadClient` and `preloadClientAfter` properties could previously be set on routes. Those properties have been removed in favor of a single `load` property now.
* Page components no longer receive `params` property in `found@0.4.x` (in case anyone used that property, but I guess no one did).
* For those who used `withRouter()` decorator previously now there's a better alternative â€” `useRouter()` hook: `const { match, router } = useRouter()`. This library no longer re-exports `found`'s `withRouter` decorator though `found` still does export it.
* Sending `GET` or `multipart/form-data` requests using `http` utility [no longer](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-website/issues/74) adds `Content-Type` header. This shouldn't be an issue for most users. For cases when reverting to the old behavior is needed, the `Content-Type` header can be set [manually](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-website/issues/74#issuecomment-496443987) via `http.onRequest(request)` hook:

```js
http: {
  onRequest: (request) => {
    if (!request.header['content-type']) {
      request.set('application/json')
    }
  }
}
```
* `http.transformUrl()` function's second argument changed from `server` to `{ server }`.

* Removed `parameters` property of `@preload()`/`load()` page preloading function, use `params` property name instead.

* The `promise()` function of an "asynchronous" Redux action (the one having `event` and `promise` properties defined) previously received three arguments: `http`, `dispatch` and `getState`. Now it receives a single argument and it's an object having shape `{ http }`.

* Removed `Promise` cancellation and the `cancelPrevious: true` Redux action parameter.

* The `path` argument of server-side settings `assets(path)`, `html.head(path)`, `html.bodyStart(path)`, `html.bodyEnd(path)` now has the ending slash character (`"/"`) trimmed.

### Renames

* Due to the library being renamed from `react-website` to `react-pages` all corresponding global `window` variables have also been renamed from `window._react_website_...` to `window._react_pages_...`. This change shouldn't affect anyone because those global variables aren't documented anywhere and aren't part of the public API.
* For those who used the `<Loading/>` component its CSS class names have been renamed from `.react-website__loading__...` to `.react-pages__loading__...`.
* For those who used `static-site-generator` the `/react-website-base` URL has been renamed to `/react-pages-base`.
* All `@@react-website/...` Redux actions have been renamed to `@@react-pages/...`. Those actions are "preload started", "preload finished" and "preload failed" and they're exported as `PRELOAD_STARTED`, `PRELOAD_FINISHED` and `PRELOAD_FAILED` respectively, so this change shouldn't break anyone's code unless not using those exports for the Redux action names. There're also some "private" ones like `@@react-website/RESOLVE_MATCH` that got renamed but I guess no one would ever have a reason to use those.

* Renamed `showPreloadInitially` setting to `showLoadingInitially`.

* Renamed `http.errorState()` setting to `http.getErrorData()`.

* Renamed `http.transformURL()` setting to `http.transformUrl()`.

* Renamed `requestedURL` parameter of `authentication.accessToken()` function to `originalUrl`.

* Renamed `requestedURL` parameter of `http.onRequest()` function to `originalUrl`.

### Removed deprecations

* `http.allowAbsoluteURLs` settings has been removed.
* `redux.v2` `v2` -> `v3` migration parameter has been removed.
* `redux.getProperties()` method has been removed.
* `redux.resetError()` method has been removed.
* `authentication.accessToken()` method's `path` parameter has been removed (use `url` parameter name instead).
* `reduxModule()` exported function has been removed, use `new ReduxModule()` notation instead.
* `redux.simpleAction()`'s `action()` argument has been removed. Instead, Redux action object is accessible directly in the `reducer` function as a second argument: `(state, actionArgument) => newState`. In other words: `redux.simpleAction()` now can only take either `(eventName, reducer)` arguments or `(reducer)` argument.

### Non-breaking dependency updates

* Updated `superagent` HTTP library from `2.x` to `5.x`. There shouldn't be any breaking changes.
* Updated Babel from `6` to `7`. No breaking changes.
* Updated `multistream` server-side library from `2.x` to `3.x`. No breaking changes.
* Updated `string-to-stream` server-side library from `1.x` to `2.x`. No breaking changes.
* Updated `cookie` server-side library from `0.3.x` to `0.4.x`. No breaking changes.
* Updated `fs-extra` server-side library from `2.x` to `8.x`. No breaking changes.
