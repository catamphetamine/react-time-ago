`react-time-ago/copy-text` was an attempt of coming up with a variant of `<ReactTimeAgo/>` that handled selecting and copying text correctly: selecting and copying something like "Alice wrote 3 days ago" doesn't carry any meaning because "3 days ago" is supposed to be a dynamically refreshed label based on current date/time, and when copied as a text it becomes isolated from that context and therefore looses meaning. Instead, selecting and copying page content should result in something like "Alice wrote on Nov 26th, 2018". This could be achieved by setting `font-size` of the verbose date label to `0px` so that it's not visible to the user but is still present in the copied text. The relative time label would still remain though, so it would be something like "Alice wrote \n Nov 26th, 2018 \n 3 days ago", so it's not an ideal workaround.
